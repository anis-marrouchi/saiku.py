## About

Saiku.py is a Python-based project aimed at creating a robust, intelligent AI Agent capable of automating various tasks. The agent follows the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework, ensuring robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

### Why Saiku?

"Saiku" (細工) in Japanese means detailed or delicate work, symbolizing the intricate and intelligent workings of our AI agent. The name reflects our commitment to precision, innovation, and advanced technology.

### What is PEAS?

PEAS stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It's a framework used to describe the components of an intelligent agent:

- **Performance Measure**: Evaluating the agent's performance
- **Environment**: The operational domain of the agent
- **Actuators**: Actions the agent can perform
- **Sensors**: How the agent perceives its environment

## Features

- Python-based Modular Design
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- Extensible and Customizable
- Features include text_to_speech, speech_to_text, chat, websocket, execute_code, text_image, and vision (video/image analysis using OpenAI Vision).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

## 1. Using Saiku.py in Your Own Projects

### Installation

- **Step**: Run `poetry add saiku.py` in your project directory.

### Usage

#### 1. Initializing Saiku Agent

- **Example**: 
  ```python
  from saiku import Agent
  agent = Agent()  # Initialize the agent
  ```

#### 2. Configuring Saiku

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```python
  options = {
      "llm": "openai",
      "actions": ["text_to_speech", "speech_to_text", "chat"]
  }
  agent.options(options)
  ```

#### 3. Interacting with Saiku

- **Example Interaction**:
  ```python
  response = await agent.interact("Hello, how can I help you?")
  print(response)
  ```

## 2. Using the Project Itself

### Usage

#### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/saiku.py.git
```

#### Navigate to Project Folder
```bash
cd saiku.py
```

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the Project Locally
```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```
